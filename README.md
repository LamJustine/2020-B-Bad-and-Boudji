# Project Title: Buskey
 **Description**: The project is the conception of an electronic key-ring. In fact, we'll create a small object, connected to the french application RATP that can allow you to see in how many time your metro, tram or bus will arrive. The user will have a small internet page interface to choose which station he wants the key-ring to print and then, the key-ring will always print in how many time the bus is coming. This is a very intersting project because it will be a big time-saving especially in the morning.
